                    <h1 class="headings">Car Racing Game</h1>
                    <p>I had completed car racing game.The car racing game is a simple Java powered 2D game. This game consists of single level or stage to play the game. We have to control the car from colliding with other cars. This game is very much fun and interesting to play.
                        This is a 2-d car racing game. The objective of the game is to prevent our car from crashing into opponents car. The opponents car come from opposite direction and with variable speed.

                        <p>I had created flappy bird game in c# windows application (.net framework). This game consist of single level or stage to play the game. The objective of the game is to prevent the bird from colliding with the pipes. The ‘SPACEBAR’ is controller of the game. Here, I had used colourful images of bird and pillars. It also display the score and ‘game over!!’ message when bird collides with other objects

                    <p>I developed this project in c++.A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list
                        includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a
                        customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system
                        searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate
                        message is displayed.
